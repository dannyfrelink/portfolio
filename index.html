                <h3>Recreating the Lay's website</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I got the assignment to
                    recreate a website of my choice. I went on to
                    look for a website that would challenge me,
                    so I could develop the most skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I was going to work with grid layouts which
                    taught me a lot. The website is fully responsive as that was one of
                    the requirements as well.

                <h3>Avocado climate impact</h3>
                <p>
                    Me and my teammates went and made an animated website to
                    show the impact of the avocado on the climate. We showed the
                    popularity of the avocado and followed with the damage of it.

                <p>
                    My part of this assignment was to take care of all the coding,
                    including making the animations through code. To animate the
                    website, we used the plugin of Greensock: ScrollTrigger.

                <h3>App remake into website</h3>
                <p>
                    During my 10 weeks of internship in my second year, I got the order
                    to remake an app into a website variant. The app showed all the
                    tumors and the way to treat them to help the doctors in the hospital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All data of this website was stored into a WordPress environment. I
                    had to use PHP to collect all the data out of there. Then I continued
                    to make templates to display all the data and styled them after.

                <h3>Compare currencies to €1</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was split up into multiple sections.
                    First of all, I needed to gather data from all
                    currencies from an API. I then resumed by cleaning up the data, so I was left
                    with the data I wanted to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created a barchart per continent and a tooltip using D3. The world map
                    and barchart are split into React components.

                    Whenever I get the chance to travel, I make sure
                    to grab it. I’ve travelled 7 months in South-East
                    Asia and can’t wait to go back.
