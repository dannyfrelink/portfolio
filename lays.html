                    This project started with some breakdown sketches to understand the layout of
                    the Lay’s website some more. As I was working Mobile First, I decided just to
                    make a breakdown sketch of the mobile version.

                After the sketches, I knew how to get started with my coding. As I said, I was
                working Mobile First, so that’s how the project started for me. Not to much time
                passed by until I got my mobile variant exactly how I wanted it to.

                The next step of this project was making the website responsive. This was the
                first time I was going to work with mediaqueries, so it took me some getting
                used to. Eventually I got the hang of it and got it working on all devices.

                As the last part of my recreation, I had to create a detail page of one of the
                flavors as well. I chose first to recreate the original detail page. After that, I
                spiced it up, by restyling the detail page with a flippable image.
